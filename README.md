## My Approach

I started out with creating UI design in figma before intuitively splitting each piece of UI into components on Reactjs. Then went on to the desktop view, achieving a responsive pages with static data and zero functionality so far.

Then i went ahead to work on my backend in PHP. Imported the data needed from the CSV into mysql DB. Made sure the desired response was recieved before connecting my front end to it to recieve real data.

## Features

- Bike trips with pagination
